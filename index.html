            <p><blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throughout the years of my education, as I am currently a second-year Information Technology student, I have acquired skills that will help me in the future.<sup>1</sup> When it comes to special skills, such as <i>programming languages</i>, I have basic knowledge of <b>Python, Java, and C#</b>.<sup>2</sup> My programming skills are not that advanced, as I only understand the logic behind them and its keywords.<sup>3</sup> However, I still consider them <i>special skills</i> because I acknowledge programming as a specialized field that requires time to master.<sup>4</sup> In terms of databases, I know how to use <b>MySQL</b>.<sup>5</sup> I also possess many <b>soft skills</b>, though not at an excellent level, but I am proud to have them and grateful for acquiring them while growing up.<sup>6</sup> I know that these soft skills will be useful in the future.<sup>7</sup> My ability to communicate and express ideas has improved over time, allowing me to collaborate effectively with others.<sup>8</sup> When it comes to teamwork or group work, I can take on both roles as a leader or a follower.<sup>9</sup> I have the ability to lead and guide people, as I voluntarily step up when no one else does.<sup>10</sup> I enjoy organizing ideas and tasks, as leading them gives me a satisfying experience.<sup>11</sup> At the same time, I can also be a follower, effectively listening to instructions and completing tasks efficiently.<sup>12</sup> I value cooperation and ensure that my contributions align with the overall goal of the team. <sup>13</sup> I can present myself in front of people, but it depends on the situation.<sup>14</sup> While I am good at presentations, I have limitations, as I sometimes lack confidence or stutter.<sup>15</sup> One of my strongest skills is my ability to easily adapt to different situations, even in critical moments, while staying calm. <sup>16</sup> Adjusting to various people and environments is challenging, but I manage to do so despite their complexities.<sup>17</sup> I believe adaptability is essential, especially in fast-changing environments like technology. <sup>18</sup> I continue to improve my skills, knowing that learning is a continuous process.<sup>19</sup> My goal is to develop both my technical and interpersonal skills to prepare for future challenges.<sup>20</sup></blockquote></p>

            <p><blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have so many hobbies that I’ve tried because I am an <b>indecisive person</b>, and I always try new things because I easily get bored.<sup>1</sup> I am a person who <i><b>knows-it-all but master of none</b></i>, like I’ve tried playing various instruments like <i>guitar, ukulele, flute, and piano</i>, but I didn’t acquire such skills, so I consider them as a hobby.<sup>2</sup> My most favorite hobby is watching movies and series as I can watch 16 episodes with an hour duration in every episode in one sitting.<sup>3</sup> I can watch 10-15 movies in a month depending on the schedule that I have, and I can watch 3-5 series depending on my mood.<sup>4</sup> I consider surfing on the internet as a hobby as it takes up my time mostly every day.<sup>5</sup> My internet addiction is so bad that I have an average screen time of 8-10 hours every day.<sup>6</sup> I spend my time watching again but in an app called TikTok as it really takes my whole time but is also very entertaining.<sup>7</sup> I love reading books, especially Filipino novels, as English novels are very complicated to read.<sup>8</sup> When I was in high school, I always brought a pocketbook, and I was known to be a girl who always brought a Wattpad book even though it was forbidden to bring things like that.<sup>9</sup> Well, I still do it, but it’s very rare because I now only read online.<sup>10</sup> I am also trying to write stories, but it’s just a pastime when I am very bored that I want to make things up.<sup>11</sup> When it comes to physical activities, I love to dance as a form of workout.<sup>12</sup> I would search up on YouTube and find a dance to sweat to.<sup>13</sup> Dancing is my way of staying active without feeling like I’m working out.<sup>14</sup> Even though I’m not good at it, I still enjoy following dance challenges.<sup>15</sup> Aside from dancing, I also enjoy walking while listening to music.<sup>16</sup> Music is also a big part of my hobbies as I always have earphones on.<sup>17</sup> I have tried learning how to draw, but I lost interest after a while.<sup>18</sup> Sometimes, I try cooking random recipes I see online just for fun.<sup>19</sup> Despite having many hobbies, I always go back to watching movies and series since it never fails to entertain me.<sup>20</sup></blockquote></p>

            <p><blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have so many fixations that no one would guess what my interests are at first glance.<sup>1</sup> I have <b>countless</b> interests, as I mentioned that I am a very indecisive person.<sup>2</sup> My main interest is Korean Pop, especially BTS—I really love Korean music and know almost all the groups and artists in that industry.<sup>3</sup> In general, I am a big fan of artists, as my music taste and genre are very wide and diverse.<sup>4</sup> I do like gaming, but I don’t play games, which is weird—I am deeply addicted to the story or lore of the game but don’t actually play it.<sup>5</sup> I just watch players playing that game, immersing myself as if I were the one playing and uncovering the deep storyline behind it.<sup>6</sup> When it comes to movies and series, I really love psychological horror or crime genres.<sup>7</sup> I am a big fan of quirky movies where there’s an artistic approach and deep symbolization.<sup>8</sup> I really want my mind blown all the time or to experience something with a great plot twist that makes my jaw drop<sup>9</sup> When it comes to series, it’s the same, but I also enjoy romantic comedies.<sup>10</sup> I don’t call myself an artistic person, but I really love painting.<sup>11</sup> They call me pessimistic as I have a weird interest in everything.<sup>12</sup> I do journaling where I write multiple entries about my daily activities or commentary on movies I’ve watched.<sup>13</sup> I am a journal junkie, even virtually, as I am addicted to recording or keeping things for the sake of memories.<sup>14</sup> I love going out alone and taking pictures of scenery, as I want to keep moments like that for myself.<sup>15</sup> Additionally, I have a weird addiction to a cartoon character named ‘Snoopy.’<sup>16</sup> I love collecting Snoopy-related items like plushies, stickers, and even clothes.<sup>17</sup> I often listen to music while journaling, as it helps me reflect on my thoughts.<sup>18</sup> I admire aesthetic things, so I always make my journals look creative, even though I don't consider myself artistic.<sup>19</sup> <i>Even though my interests constantly change, I always find comfort in exploring new things</i>.<sup>20</sup></blockquote></p>
